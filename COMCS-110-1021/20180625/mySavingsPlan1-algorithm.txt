1. Objective: calculate how much money to save every month for number of years before retirement and how much money would you have when you retire.

2. Requirements: 
--INPUT
deposit = author selected amount (for example $10, $100, etc.)
interestRate = author selects annual interest rate (for example 0.075 is 7.5%)

--PROCESSING
1. List/assign data values
2. introduction of objective, author
3. Calculate amount saved
-interestRate = interestRate / 12
-time = years * 12
-amountSaved = deposit * ((pow(1 + interestRate, time) - 1) / interestRate)
4. Output values with labels

--OUTPUT
objective
author
user instructions (if any)
label1 = "In "
label2 = " years at "
label3 = "%, $"
label4 = " deposited per month will grow to $"
years
interestRate
deposit
amountSaved

--DATA
deposit-->> how much money you will add to your savings account each month (integer)
interestRate-->> annual interest rate you can expect (check google.com: for example 0.04 is 4%) (decimal)
years-->> how many more years until you retire (integer)
amountSaved-->> how much money you have when you retire (decimal) (formatted to 2 digits past decimal point)
time-->>number of months in years (integer)

3. Algorithm Instructions
10 output objective
20 output author
30 years = how many more years until you retire 
40 deposit = how much $ to be saved each month
50 interestRate = expected interest rate on deposit expressed as a number between 0 and 1
60 interestRate = interestRate / 12
70 time = years * 12
80 amountSaved = deposit * ((pow(1 + interestRate, time) - 1) / interestRate)
90 output label1
100 output years
110 output label2
120 interestRate = (interestRate * 100) * 12
130 output interestRate
140 output label3
150 output deposit
160 output label4
170 output amountSaved formatted to 2 digits past the decimal point
180 END



4. Test Cases
Test Case #1: years=10, interestRate=7.5%, investment=$100, the expected output is: "In 10 years at 7.5% , $100 deposited per month will grow to $17793.03."

10 output objective
20 output author
30 years = 10 
40 deposit = 100
50 interestRate = 0.075
60 interestRate = interestRate / 12
70 time = years * 12
80 amountSaved = deposit * ((pow(1 + interestRate, time) - 1) / interestRate)
90 output "In "
100 output 10
110 output " years at "
120 interestRate = (interestRate * 100) * 12
130 output 7.5
140 output "%, $"
150 output 100
160 output " deposited per month will grow to $"
